Due to poor foresight and other class projects I was only able to devote a few hours into this project.
Completely my fault but still regrettable. Being completely honest here, I'm shooting for at least 5 points to maintain a B
in this class. 

I would publicly like to blame/villify the following persons/entities:


Playstation
Eileen Smith as professor of Game Design
My groupmates from Game Desgin for relying on me to create the game
My fellow men
My fellow women
God
All the Gods
Anthony Burch
And finally Brendan Eich

Thank you.
