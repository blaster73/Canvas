Get 100 circles on the screen at once to win the game. How much further can you go after 100? 
It depends on how quickly your browser crashes!

Due to poor foresight and other class projects I was only able to devote a few hours into this project.
Completely my fault but still regrettable. Being completely honest here, I'm shooting for at least 5 
points to maintain a B in this class. That being said...

I would publicly like to blame/villify the following persons/entities:


Playstation
Eileen Smith as professor of Game Design
My groupmates from Game Desgin for relying on me to create the game
Intro to C
Modeling for Realtime Systems
My fellow men
My fellow women
God
All the Gods
Anthony Burch
And finally Brendan Eich

Thank you.
